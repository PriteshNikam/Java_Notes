# Java_Coding_Questions
This repository contain coding questions and solutions to practice. This may help you for clearing basic concepts of java and will also help you for your interview preparation.

# Java_History
Java was developed by James Gosling & released in 1995, at first it was known as "Oak" afterward developers decided to give it a unique name as "Java".
Java is an island in Indonesia where the first coffee was produced (called Java coffee).

# Java
Java contain three main components - 
  1. Java Development Kit (JDK).
  2. Java Runtime Environment (JRE).
  3. Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

 ### *1) Java Development Kit (JDK)* :
- Collection of all tools used for developing & running java program.
- Provide envirnoment to develop java program.
- JRE to execute java program.
 
 ### *2) Java Runtime Environment (JRE)* :
- It provide Envirnoment to execute java program.

 ### *3) Java Virtual Machine (JVM)* :
- Compiler converts program into machine language which is byte code & JVM provides runtime envirnoment to execute this byte code.
- Here it execute program line by line which is also known as interpreter.

### Some important points -   
- Java is Hybrid language which means it is both Compiled & Interpreter language.
- Because converting .java file to .class file, java becomes platform independent which means we could run java code on any machine(Mac, Windows, Linux).


# Object-Oriented Programming(OOPs)
Java is Object-oriented Programming language.
OOPs means program using object to stand for data & methods.Here we create objects to interact with each other to change data in those objects & to work in a way that user want.
It help developers by allowing for code to be easily reused by other part of program.
OOPs languages - C++, Java, Python, Ruby, Perl, PHP.
