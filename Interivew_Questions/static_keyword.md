# static keyword - 
- static keyword are only used for static method & in static class( which is main class).
- so to use static keyword outside non-static method & class you need to use final keyword.
- If you make variable static then it will be same for all objects.
- static method donot need object in main class.
- if other class contain static method you can call this by main method using class_name.method_name();
