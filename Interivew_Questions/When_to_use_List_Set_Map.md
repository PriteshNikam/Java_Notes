# Q. When to use list,Set & Map?
->
  - It you need to access elements frequently by using index then use *list.(ArrayList)*
  - If you need to store element & want them to maintain an order on which they are inserted then use *list.*
  - If you want unique element then use *Set.*
  - If you want to store data in form of key-value pair then use *Map*.(HashMap,HashSet,TreeMap)
