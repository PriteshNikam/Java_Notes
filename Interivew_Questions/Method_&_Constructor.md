# What is difference in Method & Constructor?
-> 
  - method nedd to be called externally where as constructor is called implicitly during object initilization.
  - Both method & constructor can ne overloaded. & overrided(calling mechanisum is diff. from method)
  - You can make constructor public,private,protected similar to method.
  - Constructor name should be same as class no such condition for method.
  - constrctor are not considered as member as class.
  - for calling constructor explicitly special keyword this & super keyword is used, no such things for method.
  - *Simple words we can say Constructor is used to initialization & method to perform task.*
