# How Array sotres data location?
-> 
 - Suppose we have a Array A, so here A only stores address of 1st element.Lets consider it as 2000.
 - If array data type is integer(int) so its size will be of per element 4 bytes, so address of 1st element becomes ->
    
       2000 + 0 * 4bytes - for element at 0th position.
       2000 + 2 * 4bytes - for element at 2nd position.
