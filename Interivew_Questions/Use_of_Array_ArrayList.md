# What is use of Array/ArrayList?
->
  ## Array - 
  - It is static (unchangable of size)
  - Array has fixed length you should pre-defined length of array.
  - can store both primitiv & object.
  - you need to specify index to add in array.
  - ex - 
       
        int a[] = new int[5];
        a[0] = 1;
        a[1] = 2;
        a[2] = 3;
        a[3] = 4;
        a[4] = 5;
  
  ## ArrayList - 
  - ArrayList is dynamic.(size can be changed)
  - easy to perform operations.
  - No need to define size.
  - you can directly add elements in ArrayList.
  - ex 
     
        Arraylist<Integer> a = new ArrayList<>();
        a.add(1);
        a.add(2);
