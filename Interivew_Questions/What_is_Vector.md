# Q. What is vector & how it is different from ArrayList?
->
  - it implements list interface, it means its order collection & allows duplicates.
  - index based collection,gett(index) to retrive object from vector.
  - ArrayList is not synchronized where as vector is synchronized & thread safe.
  - due to synchronized it becomes slow.
  - it has same methods as ArrayList.
