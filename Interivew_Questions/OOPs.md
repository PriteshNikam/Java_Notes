# What is Object Oriented Progrmming(OOPs)?Give real time examples.
->
  - OOPs is a methodology to design a program using classes & objects.
  - It  simplifies software development & maintenance by providing some concepts: 
    ### Object
    ### Class
    ### Inheritance
    ### Polymorphism
    ### Abstraction
    ### Encapsulation
  
  ## Object - 
  - Any entity that has state & behaviour is known as object.
  - It can by physical or logical.
  - An object can be defined as instance of class.
  - Allocate memory when created.
 
 ## class -
 - Collection of object is called as class.
 - It id logical entity.
 - blue print of objects.
 - Donot allocate memory when created.
 
 ## Inheritance - 
 - When one object(class) acquires all propeerties & behaviours of parent object(class).
 - It provide code reusability.
 - used to achieve runtime polymorphism.(overriding).
 - eg - 
    - human.
    - car inhertate vehical.
    - Animals.
 
 ## Polymorphism - 
 - One task is performed in different ways.
 - Method overloading & overriding to achieve polymorphism.
 - two types - compile time & run time polymorphism.
 - eg - 
    - person is student at school, son at home,customer at market.
 
 ## Abstraction - 
 - Hiding internal details & showing functionality is known as abstraction.
 - Abstract class & interface are used to achieve abstraction.
 - eg - 
     - ATM
     - send message
 
 ## Encapsulation - 
 - Binding (or wrapping) code & data together into a single unit are known as encapsulation.
 - This can be done by using accress modifiers - public,private,protected.
 - eg - 
    - school bag(consist of book,pen,tiffin,etc)
    - Bank account.(your balance is only visible to you not for public).
